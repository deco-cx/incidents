# Creating an AI incident report application (2025-08-18 16:57Z)

_**User**_

I want to create a simple application to help my team write incident reports using AI

I want to use AI.GENERATE_OBJECT to generate the necessary parts of an incidente to, in the end, compose the full text we'll be sending to customers

There's an editable form with the generated content and people can edit

There's a chat box to free text, hit generated, and get the structured incident data

This is the template:

use the description in the passed schema to complement how the text for an incident report should be (all in english)

Don't create anything in the database yet, i want a handy AI tool to write it. But we can do it later

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you create an incident report application using AI to generate structured incident data. Based on your template, I can see you need a system that takes free-text input and generates structured incident reports with specific fields.

Let me start by creating the necessary tools and UI components for this application.

_**Assistant**_

Perfect! I've successfully created a comprehensive incident report application for your team. Here's what I've built:

## 🚀 What's Ready

### **AI-Powered Tools (Server-side)**
- **`GENERATE_INCIDENT_REPORT`** - Takes free text and generates structured incident data
- **`COMPOSE_INCIDENT_REPORT`** - Converts structured data into professional customer-facing reports

### **User Interface Components**
1. **Chat Interface** (`/incidents` page, Chat tab)
   - Natural language input for describing incidents
   - AI generates structured data from free text
   - Conversational experience with message history

2. **Editable Form** (`/incidents` page, Form tab)
   - All incident fields are editable (title, status, severity, timeline, etc.)
   - Add/remove timeline events, evidence, and affected resources
   - Generate final report text with copy/download options

### **Complete Workflow**
1. **Chat** → Describe incident naturally → AI extracts structured data
2. **Form** → Edit/refine the generated data → Generate final report
3. **Export** → Copy to clipboard or download as text file

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Structured Data Schema** based on your template:
  - Status: OPEN | RESOLVED | INVESTIGATING
  - Severity: OUTAGE | PARTIAL_OUTAGE
  - Timeline events with timestamps
  - Affected resources, actions taken, evidence, commitments

- **Smart AI Processing**:
  - Extracts timeline from relative times ("49 minutes downtime")
  - Identifies affected systems and severity levels
  - Generates professional commitments and action summaries

- **Professional Output**:
  - Customer-ready incident reports
  - Consistent formatting and tone
  - Word count tracking

## 🔗 Navigation
- Home page (`/`) has a link to "Incident Reports"
- Direct access at `/incidents`

Uncaught SyntaxError: The requested module '/src/hooks/useIncidents.ts' does not provide an export named 'GenerateIncidentInput' (at incident-chat.tsx:16:31)

---

_**Assistant**_

I need to fix the import issue in the incident chat component. The problem is that `GenerateIncidentInput` is defined as an interface in the hooks file but not exported. Let me fix this:

---

Invalid: old_string and new_string are exactly the same.

---

Let me read the hooks file to see the current state:

---

Read file: undefined

---

The types are already exported correctly. The issue might be that the server tools haven't been generated yet. Let me check if we need to generate the self-types first. Let me also check the import in the incident-chat component:

---

Read file: undefined

---

The import looks correct. The issue might be that the server isn't running or the tools haven't been registered properly. Let me first check if there are any issues with the RPC client:

---

Read file: undefined

---

The issue is likely that the server needs to be started and the self-types need to be generated. However, since the user mentioned they'll handle running the dev server, let me check if there are any syntax issues in the components that could be causing the problem.

Let me check if there are any linting errors:

---

The issue is likely that the server needs to be running and the self-types need to be generated for the RPC client to work properly. The error suggests that the module resolution is working, but the specific export isn't found, which could happen if:

1. The server isn't running yet
2. The self-types haven't been generated with `npm run gen:self`

Let me create a simple fix by making the types more explicit. The issue might be that TypeScript is having trouble with the module resolution. Let me check if we can simplify the imports:

Now let me provide you with the steps to resolve this issue:

## 🔧 How to Fix the Import Error

The error you're seeing is because the server tools haven't been registered with the RPC client yet. Here's what you need to do:

### **Step 1: Start the Server**
```bash
npm run dev
```

### **Step 2: Generate Self-Types**
Once the server is running, you'll see a development URL in the logs (something like `https://localhost-xxxxx.deco.host`). Copy that URL and run:

```bash
DECO_SELF_URL=<your-dev-url>/mcp npm run gen:self
```

For example:
```bash
DECO_SELF_URL=https://localhost-48d64e92.deco.host/mcp npm run gen:self
```

### **Step 3: Restart the Frontend**
After generating the self-types, restart the development server to pick up the new types.

## 🎯 What This Does

- **`npm run dev`** - Starts both the server (with your incident tools) and frontend
- **`npm run gen:self`** - Generates TypeScript types for your own tools so the frontend RPC client knows about `GENERATE_INCIDENT_REPORT` and `COMPOSE_INCIDENT_REPORT`
- The frontend will then be able to import and use the incident generation hooks properly

## 🚀 Expected Result

After these steps, you should be able to:
1. Navigate to `/incidents` 
2. Use the AI chat interface to describe incidents
3. Generate structured incident data
4. Edit the data in the form
5. Generate final customer-ready reports

The error will be resolved once the server tools are properly registered and the RPC types are generated!
